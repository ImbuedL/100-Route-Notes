100% Route Notes


Things I need to add:
- doing turtle room stray fairy in GBT before bk skip to save pause


Some things that need to be timed/tested:
- observatory 2 heap manip and whether or not bunny is worth

- goron worth it in sakon's? (EDIT: no, extra pause and only saves half a second without accounting for equips)
- time real chu goron boost to graveyard after stone mask (EDIT: saves maybe .1s or .2s, not really worth)
- time getting crushed by door vs voiding after mask of scents (EDIT: getting crushed is good despite the mask transition)


- time cremia ride lag stuff
- is hookshot worth using for first hit on twinmold trial garo master?


Other Notes:
- ISTT Wizrobe Chest CS Skip has a 3 frame window
- gyorg cs skip visual cue if 2nd frame weirdshot (move down until bottom of A button on wall, move left slightly)
